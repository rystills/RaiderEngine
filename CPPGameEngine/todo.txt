~Rendering~
-implement gamma correct option on model load
-reimplement forward rendering techniques in deferred renderer
	-HDR
	-bloom
	-blending (using forward pass)
	-shadows
-SSAO
-Text rendering
-implement either deferred lighting or tile-based deferred shading so that light volumes can be utilized properly
-reimplement spotlights / directional lights
-add silhouette generation to POM

~Usage~
-document install requirements
-automate building, similar to how glitter lays it out

~Map Files~
-store maps in 3ds max fbx files
-load via a separate assimp function, storing maps, models, textures, etc.. each in their own folder
-in maps, objects are defined by their name, which can be:
	-o_className(constructorArgs) => for a class that should be instantiated
	-s_meshName => for a static mesh that exists only in that specific map (ie. a static ground plane with pom details)

~Physics~
-integrate bullet physics

~Optimization~
-add automatic object instancing
