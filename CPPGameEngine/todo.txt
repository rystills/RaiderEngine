~Rendering~
-implement gamma correct option on model load
-reimplement forward rendering techniques in deferred renderer
	-HDR
	-bloom
	-blending (using forward pass)
	-spotlights w/ shadows
	-bake static shadows for stationary lights
-SSAO
-implement either deferred lighting or tile-based deferred shading so that light volumes can be utilized properly
-add silhouette generation to POM

~Usage~
-document install requirements
-automate building, similar to how glitter lays it out

~Optimization~
-add automatic object instancing
-reset object to starting position if it falls below the lowest map position - 100
-send lights to shader in order of distance from player and importance, and render shadows for first N lights
-split classes into separate .h and .cpp files
-file paths should be handled in a more consistent manner throughout the project
